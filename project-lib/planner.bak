### Basic Types ###

#  - Latitudes and longitudes are numbers:
let Lat?  = num?
let Lon?  = num?

#  - Point-of-interest categories and names are strings:
let Cat?  = str?
let Name? = str?

### Raw Item Types ###

#  - Raw positions are 2-element vectors with a latitude and a longitude
let RawPos? = TupC[Lat?, Lon?]

#  - Raw road segments are 4-element vectors with the latitude and
#    longitude of their first endpoint, then the latitude and longitude
#    of their second endpoint
let RawSeg? = TupC[Lat?, Lon?, Lat?, Lon?] ##

#  - Raw points-of-interest are 4-element vectors with a latitude, a
#    longitude, a point-of-interest category, and a name
let RawPOI? = TupC[Lat?, Lon?, Cat?, Name?]

### Contract Helpers ###

# ListC[T] is a list of `T`s (linear time):
let ListC = Cons.ListC
# List of unspecified element type (constant time):
let List? = Cons.list?
